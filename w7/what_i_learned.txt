In lab w7 I had to parse a string that is read from a file using the class String
parsing functions. Once the string is parse I would insert in a Product class
which I would next insert in a STL vector that would be held in my Sale class.


Things that I have learn, I learn how to work better with the find, substr functions of
the String class. I also learned how to work with the vector STL container better.
